        <p>Kyle Devine is a songwriter, beatmaker and producer from Portland, OR
            Growing up the only thing Kyle Devine could count on was music. If he had any home it was in the beats
            and melodies pumping through his headphones.

            By the time he was in high school (Devine attended four), his experience was entirely colored by the
            work of Dr Dre, Timbaland, & DJ Premier. After picking up a copy of a well-known wav editing software he
            began studying the music that had guided him through his teenage years; examining waveforms, looping
            portions, manipulating sound into new forms.

            Over the years he developed a name as a producer, built his own studio space, and worked with the cream
            of the crop from the Northwest while also licensing material to national brands such as Nissan,
            McDonalds and Vice. However, the resonance of the music that he felt as a young man growing up was
            disappearing.

            After some soul searching, Kyle found his way to the other side with renewed optimism. Through his
            rediscovery of the power of music to provide an emotional, mental, and physiological safe place, he set
            out to provide a way for other artists to heal and share their healing process though music.
