    <h4>Bio:</h4>
    <article>
        <p> Kyle Devine is a musician, mixing engineer, and beatmaker residing near Portland, OR.
            Growing up, the only thing he could count on was music. If he had any home it was in the beats
            and melodies pumping through his headphones.

            By the time he was in high school (Devine attended four), his experience was entirely colored by the
            work of Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Pete Rock & DJ Premier. After picking up a copy of a well-known wav editing
            software, he
            began studying the music that had guided him through his teenage years; examining waveforms, looping
            portions, manipulating sound into new forms.

            Over the years, he developed a name as a producer and helped over one hundred singers and rappers while also
            licensing material to national brands such as Nissan, Google, Adidas, McDonalds and Vice. However, the
            resonance of the music that he felt as a young man growing up was disappearing.

            After some soul searching, Kyle found his way to the other side with renewed optimism. Through his
            rediscovery of the power of music to provide an emotional, mental, and physiological safe place, he set
            out to provide a way for other artists to heal and share their healing process though music.
